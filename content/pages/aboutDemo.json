    "body": "The EnerygSHR platform has been built for TU Delft and Erasmus University Rotterdam as part of their cooperation in [Convergence](https://convergence.nl/nl/).\n\nEnergySHR aims at practically experiencing how data and algorithms, preferably tensely linked to each other, can be shared, as a basis for better cooperation on energy transition research and innovation between scientists from academia, public and private sector, to accelerate research, collaboration and innovation in the energy transition."

    "title": "Objectives",
    "body": "· Implement an open-source, practical example to experience and discuss future-proof data and algorithm sharing for research and innovation in the energy transition.\n· Use an example Gaia-X implementation for comparison with other data sharing initiatives (not to compete but to collaborate on achieving the best future-proof solution)\n· Provide a base infrastructure that may be leveraged for facilitating proof of concepts collaborations between academia and other organizations;\n\nThese topics apply to many other public and private organizations in the Netherlands and other countries. In upcoming phases interested public and private organizations can start participating in this initiative. For instance, by sharing or accessing datasets or algorithms through EnergySHR."
