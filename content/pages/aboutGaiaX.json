Gaia-X focusses on the implementation of a decentralized, federated cloud- and data sharing infrastructure. Both public and private, cross-border. Non-European parties can participate but the rules are set based on the EU values: Openness, Fairness, Privacy, Security and Transparency.",

On the basis of technical specifications, services based on open-source code are being developed. They will then be developed into operational services and continuously improved by the Gaia-X Community.  These services are available for everyone who whishes to use them for their own implementations.",

This means that only (selected) scientists of Delft University of Technology and Erasmus University Rotterdam can use EnergySHR in this pilot phase. In the future the provider and consumer organizations could be any public or private organization, as long as they comply with the rules as set by the federator of EnergySHR and the high-level Gaia-X compliance rules.",
