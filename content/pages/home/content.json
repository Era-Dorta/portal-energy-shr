        "text": "The energy system is transforming from a centralized, fossil fuel-based, automatic control-dominated system into a system with increased complexity due to decentralised produced renewable energy. The integration between the electrical grid, gases (like hydrogen) and heat systems and reduced time-limits for system control adds to this complexity."

These solutions contribute to solving issues related to decision making for coordination & control of energy systems (balancing the grid, congestion, and flexibility), long-term planning and support interactions in the energy system."

It allows data scientists, data consumers and data providers, like grid operators, local government, energy service providers and energy companies to share, collaborate and commercialize their data services. EnergySHR facilitates doing this in a secure and privacy-friendly manner and ensures that data owners stay in full control over their data."
